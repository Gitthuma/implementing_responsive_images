Active learning: Implementing your own responsive images

For this active learning, we're expecting you to be brave and go it alone ... mostly. We want you to implement your own suitable art directed narrow screen/wide screen shot using &lt;picture&gt;, and a resolution switching example that uses srcset.

1. Write some simple HTML to contain your code (use not-responsive.html as a starting point, if you like).

2. Find a nice wide screen landscape image with some kind of detail contained in it somewhere. Create a web-sized version of it using a graphics editor, then crop it to show a smaller part that zooms in on the detail, and create a second image (about 480px wide is good for this).

3. Use the &lt;picture&gt; element to implement an art direction picture switcher!

4. Create multiple image files of different sizes, each showing the same picture.

5. Use srcset/size to create a resolution switcher example, either to serve the same size image at different resolutions, or different image sizes at different viewport widths.
